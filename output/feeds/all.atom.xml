&lt;p&gt;This paper is about implementing an ELECTRA language model for a specific Indian language, which is possibly going to be Punjabi, using training code that is available on the internet and running it on some sort of cloud or on-premises environment which has the GPU power required to do this task as well as the availability in terms of time. The current expectation is that such a task takes days on a single GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language model needs to be trained on an unstructured corpus of data in the language of choice using a tokenizer, both of which are made available online by multiple organizations, the most prominent of which is &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co"&gt;Huggingface&lt;/a&gt; (often represented by ðŸ¤—).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category></entry></feed>
