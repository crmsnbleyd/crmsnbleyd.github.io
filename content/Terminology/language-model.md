Simply put, a language model is the way of representing a language in the form of numerical data for computation purposes.

Earlier, grammar based language models were used, which were made by hand using knowledge of the language but recently, we are moving on to more statistical methods, especially using [artificial neural networks]({filename}/Neural_Networks/ann.md).
