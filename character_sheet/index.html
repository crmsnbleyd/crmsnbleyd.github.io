        <div class="card-text">
          You were taken to become a witcher when you were young, 
          between 4 and 6 years old. You had some normal memories 
          to aid you when taking the Trial of the Grasses. You trained 
          at Gorthwr Gwaed in the deep chasms of the Tir Tochair Mountains. 
          Unlike other witchers, you were trained on an assassination-based 
          approach to killing monsters. After helping a city with a monster, 
          the people became afraid and turned on you. They might have even tried 
          to kill you. Either way, you’ve seen what kind of reward you can expect from people.

          If you can see a creature’s mouth while it is speaking a language 
        you understand, you can interpret what it’s saying by reading its lips.

          <li>You can no longer be surprised by any enemy, and any creature trying to frighten you is at disadvantage</li>

        <h3 class="card-title text-center">Great Weapon Fighting</h3>
        <div class="card-text">
          When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon 
          that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. 
          The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

        <div class="card-text">
          On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduce a creature to
           0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action. Before 
           you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon with which you are proficient, you can 
           choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll.
           If you do so and the attack hits, it deals +10 damage

        <h3 class="card-title text-center">Blade of Sickness</h3>
        <div class="card-text">
          As an action you can coat your blade in a debilitating toxin, causing
          your successful attacks to impose disadvantage on all of your opponents attacks on their next turn. The toxin lasts for 1d4 turns until its potency is gone. If the target is immune to poison this toxin has no effect. You can craft the toxin using your alchemist kit, the process takes 1 hour to gather materials to craft 2 vials of toxin. Non Witchers can use the toxin for their blades but they must make a constitution saving throw against a DC 13 when applying it. If they fail 
          the save they are poisoned for 1d4 turns and have disadvantage on all attacks for the duration.

          You are able to use your reaction to reduce the damage dealt by a ranged weapon by1d8 + 
          your level + your Dexterity modifier . If the damage is reduced to 0 you can spend 2
           Vigor foreach ranged shot in order to 
          make a ranged weapon attack and return the projectile with Aard if you possess that sign.
